# event-calendar-5

## Description
This work day scheduler will allow workers to log events and/or messages for specific hours of their work day. Once a worker is done writing their event/message, they will need to press the save button off to the right in order to save it. The hour row block will be dynamically colored either grey for the past, red for the present, or green for the future. A date time will be updated every second in the header.
